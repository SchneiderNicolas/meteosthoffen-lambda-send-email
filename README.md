# meteosthoffen-lambda-send-email

This repository contains code to handle a contact form for the meteosthoffen website. When a user submits the contact form, an email acknowledgement is sent to the user, and an email with the contact information is sent to the appropriate person at meteosthoffen. The email sending process is handled by AWS SES. The code is automatically deployed on an AWS Lambda function that is connected to an API Gateway.
